1. Read the existing content in CHANGELOG.md - if it doesn't exist, create one.
2. Based on your activity in this session, create an appropriate summary of the activity and add it to CHANGELOG.md
3. Once you are done updating CHANGELOG.md, stage the changed file(s) for a git commit, create a short appropriate commit message, and push the changes in git.
